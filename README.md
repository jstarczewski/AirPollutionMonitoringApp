# AirPollutionMonitoringApp
Simple android App that shows air pollution level in the biggest cities of Poland.
## About AirPollutionMonitoring
AirPollutionMonitoring is a App version of project that I created to pass "The basics of Software Engineering" course. Created to show my basic understanding of popular Android liblaries and frameworks and as a training before building another "real" project. <br/> During development process I learned and practiced how to : <br/>
- [x] follow a basic Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture with Dagger (when needed)
- [x] use dependency injection framewroks both for views (ButterKnife) and modules (Dagger 2)
- [x] retrive data asynchronously with RXJava
- [x] consume REST API in JSON format with Retrofit and Moshi adapter 
## Furuture of AirPolltuionMonitoringApp
There is no future of AirPollutionMonitoringApp. The whole project was created to practice basic usage of frameworks mentioned above. Now I will probably end up learning Kotlin, MVVM and building real project that will be uploaded to Google Play Store
